# Inflation and Gold

(main code is in Inflation_and_Gold.py)

I collected publically available data on the monthly changes in inflation rate (more specifically CPI 12) and the price of gold in the UK. The code merges and cleans the required datasets to then create a graph that compares the change in CPI-12 and the price of gold over time.

The data runs from November 2013 to November 2023.

The code outputs the figure below.

**Notes**:
* CPI seems to be fluctuating with a period of about 4 years. The 'high-inflation period' of 2022/23 is an anomaly within this fluctuation.
* CPI reaches lowest local value at peak covid period, although this could be attributed to regular fluctuation in CPI.
* Price of gold begins to rump up before start of COVID pandemic. What could have caused this?

Could it be that the rise in the price of gold could have been an early indicator of the subsequent rise in inflation?
